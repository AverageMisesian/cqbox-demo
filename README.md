The game is about a soldier who returned to serve his country. 
His mission was to destroy air defense systems, but a drone detected his team and launched a missile that killed everyone except him. 
His radio was destroyed, and no one knows his location, assuming he was killed. 
With no food or water, stranded in the cold desert, he spots an enemy base. 
Now he has only two options: die in the desert, or fight his way through the base, take supplies, and use their radio to call for help.
